Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 1

In order to perform the cleaning process on this dataset:-
Extract the run_analysis.R file in the main directory while downloading the UCI HAR DATASET in the directory as well((https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). Make sure that your working directory is the UCI HAR Dataset.
Run the .R file which generates a cleaned .txt with the data as well as a .txt with the averages data aptly named. These files are generated and located in the Dataset folder.
